Problem Statement : Predicting Stock Price of APPL using LSTM model
About Dataset
APPLE Stock Prediction
This dataset contains historical data of Apple's stock prices and related attributes. It consists of 7 columns and a smaller subset of 10774 rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row contains the corresponding values for that attribute.
The columns in the dataset are as follows:
1. Date: The year and date of the stock data.
2. Open: The opening value of Apple's stock on the given day.
3. High: The highest value reached by Apple's stock on the given day.
4. Low: The lowest value reached by Apple's stock on the given day.
5. Close: The closing price of Apple's stock on a particular day.
6. adjClose: The adjusted closing price of Apple's stock, considering factors such as dividends and stock splits.
7. Volume: The trading volume of Apple's stock on the given day, i.e., the number of shares traded.



TASK 2 : TITANIC CLASSIFICATION
Algorithm which tells whether the person will be save from sinking or not
Purpose
Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

STEPS INVOLVED :
1. Problem understanding and definition
2. Data Loading and Importing the necessary libraries
3. Data understanding using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering and Data Processing
5. Feature Engineering and Data Processing
6. Model Evaluation
